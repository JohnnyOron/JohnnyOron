- 👋 Hi, I’m @JohnnyOron
- 👀 I’m interested in computer programming and engineering in multiple computer languages.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning python as a main language while actively dolving in other languages such as: Go, NodeJS, C/C++, Java and Html5.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on any project that may include the aforementioned languages and that suits my skill level.
- 📫 You can reach me via email: oronjohnny@gmail.com
